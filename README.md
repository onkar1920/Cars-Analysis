# Cars-Analysis
PROJECT NAME -: CARS

1)Table of Content-: *Demo Overview *Reason to Choose these Project *Pandas Methods which are used in these project *Graph which are used *Workdone *Conclusion *Result


2)Reason to Choose these Project-: *Firstly I'm huge fan of Cars and when it comes to its features and models it is most interesting . *Through this Dataset i want to conclude that the cars which are having enginesize increases the horsepower also increases , after my analysis i want to come to a strategy that if the horsepower increases then the engine size as well as the cylinders also increases .

3)Pandas Methods which are used in these project-: *info(),desribe(),isna(),sum(),fillna() *value_counts(),groupby() *idxmax(),idxmin(),nlargest() 

4)Graph which are used-: ->For plotting i have used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn

Bar graph
Pie chart
Countplot
Heat map
5)Workdone-: *By using fillna i have filled all the Null values with mean in the dataset *By using value_counts i got a name and the count of cars who has the highest count in brand ,same as model also and i use it in Graphs also *By using idxmax and idxmin i got the top and bottom i.e highest and lowest of the columns,were i have used it such has brand and models. *I used nlargest because by dataset is very big to visualize the data properly on the following graph i have drawn the top (n) cars brand or models using it. *I used groupby where i need the reference of some other column.*I used countplot where the data is more and to visualize it properly.

6)Conclusion-: *From above analysis i have concluded 1]Brand having more demand in resale market--> Nissan,Honda,Mercedes-Benz,Volkswagen,Chrysler 2]car model with highest count in market--> G35 4dr 3]car type with highest count in market--> Sedan 4]Origin in market-->ASIA(40.17%),USA(33.71),Europe(26.12%) 5]Car Enginesize to Horsepower relation as enginesize increace the horsepower also increases. 6]Cars in market after their production as 4 cylinders they are Volvo,Volkswagen,Chevrolet,Acura,Audi and the 8 cylinders one are Porsce,Pontiac,Volkswagen 7]Cars Range = Kia,Hyundai,Saturn starting from MSRP  $10200−$12000 𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑀𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑠𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑧,𝐴𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎,𝐽𝑎𝑔𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 $86000-$99000

7)RESULT-: After my analysis I have  conclude that the cars which are having enginesize increase the horsepower also increases and cylinders also increases.
